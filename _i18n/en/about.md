### An idea will not change the world if you hide it in your brain. 

Unhide your ideas please!

Unhidea is a website to post my ideas, Hope some of them will inspire you and make a difference.


I believe that ideas deserve to be shared.

### Our brain is  most ideas' final tomb. Ideas die in there.

An idea has no value unless we implement it.
But unfortunately, most people that are full of original ideas have no time, energy or ability to implement their ideas.

So unhide your ideas, let others who have time, money and ability to implement them. Don't let them die in your brain lonely.
